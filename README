GTD Task Transfer is an application that allows GTD application users to transfer
their task data between other GTD applications.

== Description ==
The reason this exists is because I wanted to start using a GTD application, but
didn't want all my data to be stuck with that one application. So, I needed a way
to easily transfer data (if the GTD application supports exporting data to a CSV
format) from one app to another while I was trying out different GTD applications.

As of the last update of this README (2011-03-12), only importing data from a CSV
file into TaskWarrior is supported.  I have written the script in such a way that
it should be self-explanatory to add future functionality.

== Usage ==
Example:
    To list supported file types:
    ./gtd-task-transfer import -h

    To list supported GTD applications:
    ./gtd-task-transfer import csv -h

    To list supported TaskWarrior fields to import:
    ./gtd-task-transfer import csv /path/to/exported/tasks.csv taskwarrior -h

    To preview what will be called to import tasks:
    ./gtd-task-transfer import --preview csv /path/to/exported/tasks.csv taskwarrior -d 0 -P 1 -p 2

    To perform the import:
    ./gtd-task-transfer import csv /path/to/exported/tasks.csv taskwarrior -d 0 -P 1 -p 2
    
== Installation ==
I developed this project in Linux (Ubuntu 10.04) with Python 2.6.5 and 2.7. The
only installation is to copy the gtd-task-transfer.py file to a place you can
execute it, and follow the examples above.

 = Prerequisites =
 The following libraries or programs were what I used.

 - Python 2.7       (perhaps > 2.7, but I haven't tested it)
    - uses argparse and subprocess.call
