GTD Task Transfer is an application that allows GTD application users to transfer
their task data between other GTD applications.

== Description ==
The reason this exists is because I wanted to start using a GTD application, but
didn't want all my data to be stuck with that one application. So, I needed a way
to easily transfer data (if the GTD application supports exporting data to a CSV
format) from one app to another while I was trying out different GTD applications.

== Usage ==
Example:
    
== Installation ==
I developed this project in Linux (Ubuntu 10.04) with Python 2.6.5.

 = Prerequisites =
 The following libraries or programs were what I used.

 - Python 2.6.5     (perhaps > 2.6.5, but I haven't tested it)
